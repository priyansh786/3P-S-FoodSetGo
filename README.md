# 3P-S-FoodSetGo
FOOD DELIVERY CONSOLE BASED APP
It finds the shortest path between two end points i.e from Source to Destination .
The aditional option that this project provide is that it asks user to input their choice of food outlet they want to visit
and then accordingly it show the shortest path passing through that outlet
This Project mainly uses Dijkstra Algorithm to calculate the path.
In order to show the shortest path we have used Graphics of C++ Library.
